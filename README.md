Oasis is a hospital management system developed as a solution for the following scenario.

Scenario:
	A Hospital consists of a number of specialized wards (such as Maternity, Pediatrics, Oncology,
Gynecologist etc.). Each ward has a number of patients, who are admitted on the
recommendation of external physicians (may be their family doctors) and confirmed by a
consultant employed by the Hospital. On admission, the personal details of every patient are
recorded. A separate register is to be held to store information of tests undertaken and results
of a prescribed treatment. A number of tests may be conducted for each patient. Each patient
is assigned to one leading consultant, but may be examined by another doctor, if required.
Doctors are specialists in some branch of medicine and may be leading consultants for a
number of patients, not necessarily from the same ward.
	Payment details of each patient needs to be recorded separately. The hospital management
requires to maintain the details of the employees of the hospital (Doctors, Nurses, Maintenance
staff etc.) The attendance of the employees needs to be recorded in order to process their
salaries.
